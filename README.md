The aim of this stylesheet is to create a theme that takes on-board UX and style
guidelines - however there is no goal to follow them to the letter. Which style
guidelines exactly? YOU DECIDE!

## Usage
Just drop the CSS file into `css/theme/`, and change the stylesheet reference in
your slide's HTML.
